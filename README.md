# The Symbolic Mind - Syllabus

## Description

Can machines think? This course investigates the core characteristics of
the digital mind and will analyze it from different human perspectives,
such as thinking, intelligence, imagination and ethics. The course will
touch upon key concepts in the ways machines work, such as programming,
logic and artificial intelligence in order to better understand the
benefits and risks found in machines, technology and bots that are an
inseparable part of our modern lives.
