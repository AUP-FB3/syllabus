## W1RS

1. To explain Abstraction, Professor Harvey used the automobile as an
example, with its many layers of complexity, and the "two pedals, one
steering wheel" interface that has stood the test of time. Imagine you
were teaching abstraction to a ten-year-old. Describe another
non-computing innovation, its abstraction layers, and at least one of
its interfaces (indicate whether it has changed over time or not).
2. Abstraction allows us to focus on the important aspects of something and
put the details aside for later. Describe a process where you utilize
abstraction: what parts are the high-level ideas and what parts are the
low-level details you "abstract away"? What is the the crossover point
where you stop talking about the abstract concepts and get around to
talking about the details?
3. Are there ever situations where we don't use Abstraction? Where are the
details that are so important that we cannot afford to miss them or hide
them?

## W2RS

1. Was there anything you disagreed with, or thought was overstated?
2. Which Koan was the most enlightening (i.e., taught you the most) and
what did you believe before reading it?
3. The book was written in 2008; what feels the most dated? Said another
way, was there anything that has happened since then that you would make
sure to put in Chapter 1 if the book were rewritten today?

## W3RS

1. The authors argue we gave away our privacy to save time, money,
convenience, exhibitionism, or "because you can't live any other way".
Are there times when you do not give in to the trade-off? Why? (e.g.,
you do not sign up for reward cards because you do not want supermarkets
knowing what you buy, you pay cash because you do not want credit card
companies to track you, etc.)
2. In terms of internet exposure, where do you fall on the scale of 1-10
(where 1 might be an Amish family with no electricity, and 10 might be
Jennifer Kay Ringley who used her "Jennicam" to document everything
about her life for 7 years.) and why? E.g., Do you have a website? Write
a blog? Post photos and videos of yourself to social media?
3. What would your reaction be if people in your neighborhood started using
devices (for their own interest) that could affect your personal
privacy? (e.g., flying drones overhead, wearing "Google Glass"-like
eyeglasses, installing security cameras outside their house / apartment,
etc.) Would you speak up?4
4. In the United States, legislators have toyed with requiring always-on
body cameras on police officers in the United States. What are some of
the key benefits and shortcomings of that proposal?
5. The second half of the reading talks about various attempts to erudite
leaders to define what privacy is and what rights the individual should
have. If you were to concisely articulate what rights every person on
earth should have with regard to privacy, what would it be? (Consider
elements like "the right to know WHO has your information", "the right
to BAN a group from collecting information about you", "the right to
CORRECT the information they have about you", "the right to be FORGOTTEN
(i.e., for all the people who have information about me, delete ALL of
it)", etc.)
6. Now consider the opposite side of the coin. Do governments, society, or
institutions have any rights to have your information? (i.e., Would it
really make sense to be able to tell your National Security
Administration [aka Ministry of Defense and Intelligence, etc.] that
they can't know about you? That said, don't the same "surveillance"
mechanisms that can prevent terrorism allow a state to silence all
dissent? Where's the line?)

## W4RS

1. What do you think about the idea that search engine caches are partly to
"blame" for the loss of our privacy? That is, any information about you
available on the web (even for an instant) can get captured by any one
of the millions of roving spiders, and archived for eternity. The EU has
a "right to be forgotten" law that exists for exactly that reason, to
force search engines to remove traces of your digital footprint (we'll
see more of that in a few weeks) from its caches.
2. Given how much "power" search engines now have, do you think they should
be regulated by some agency? Argue your case. Recall how Google "stung"
BMW for what they perceived to be an attempt to "rig" the search
results. What prevents a search engine site from doing that to any
company or group they don't like? "Who watches the search engines?"
3. You're a search engine provider. A country comes to you, whose income
is mostly funded by the sale of tobacco, and wants their people to
believe that tobacco products are extremely healthy and invigorating.
They want all searches of tobacco in their country to return listings
that support their false claims. What is the right call (i.e., comply
with local laws (as Google finally did with China) or refuse to alter
your automatically-generated searches and rankings)? Argue your point.
Where should a company draw the line, if ever?
4. Again, you're a search engine provider. A brutally repressive country
wants to know all the users who searched for terms that refer to
terrorist acts against their country. Perhaps that's reasonable in the
name of national security. What if they then can ask for the users who
simply speak poorly of their leader? Or of all the people whose search
terms might indicate they belong to a minority ethnic or religious
group? Or of all the people who are advocating that women should have an
equal right to education (e.g., Malala Yousafzai)? What should your
policy be around what search data is released and to whom?

## W5RS

1. There's a section heading entitled "Having a Good System Doesn't Mean
People Will Use It", and it talks about the challenge to get the masses
to use encryption on a regular basis. We all use it for our Internet
commerce, because it's built in to the web browsers (ever notice the
lock symbol to the left of the "https" window above when you're doing
online shopping?). Would you advocate that all email systems incorporate
encryption to be on "by default", even if it meant that the email of
"dumb bad guys" (who weren't encrypting their email) was harder to
monitor? (I.e., do the benefits outweigh the problems?)
2. Blown to Bits says:
The risks of insecure encryption today arise from three forces acting in
consort: the high speed at which news of insecurities travels among
experts, the slow speed at which the inexpert recognize their
vulnerabilities, and the massive scale at which cryptographic software
is deployed.
Of the three "forces" that are continually preventing everyone from
having the most updated encryption software, which is the dominant
reason? What can we as a society do to address it?
3. The last two sentences in Blown to Bits are: “The legal and economic
   (and technical -Dan) decisions being made today, not just about bits
but about everything that depends on bits, will determine how our
descendants will lead their lives. The way the bits illuminate or
distort the world will shape the future of humanity.”. Are you
optimistic or pessimistic about the way things will play out, for
families, friends and society? Will cybercriminals become more
dangerous, our physical and digital mistakes captured more frequently
and instantly shared with a billion people and archived forever, and our
personal freedoms continued to be stripped away so that free speech and
thought will be a thing of the past? Or will it give “the good guys”
even more tools to fight crime, help root out government oppression and
police brutality (via cell phones and body cameras), and give voice to
the unheard, views to the unseen, and representation to the
underrepresented.
4. Andrew Blum talks about wanting to peek below the abstraction of the
“cloud” and “Internet” to its physical underpinnings. He discovers it’s
just copper, fiber, insulation, and a whole lot of people, machinery,
buildings, boats and ocean floor. The people involved are engineers,
ship captains, divers, “jewelers”, and local laborers. What was the most
surprising thing you learned from the video?

## W6RS

1. Where do you fall on the Net Neutrality debate (for or against) and why?
One of the engineering triumphs of the architectural design of the
2. Internet is that "the Internet of yesterday did not focus on the today
of yesterday". Name another system (that has survived the test of time
and societal / technological transformations in ways the designers
couldn't have imagined) and describe what aspects of its design made it
so able to age gracefully.
