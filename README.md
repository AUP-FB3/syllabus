| W1RS | 1. To explain Abstraction, Professor Harvey used the automobile
as an example, with its many layers of complexity, and the "two pedals,
one steering wheel" interface that has stood the test of time. Imagine
you were teaching abstraction to a ten-year-old. Describe another
non-computing innovation, its abstraction layers, and at least one of
its interfaces (indicate whether it has changed over time or not).
2. Abstraction allows us to focus on the important aspects of something and
put the details aside for later. Describe a process where you utilize
abstraction: what parts are the high-level ideas and what parts are the
low-level details you "abstract away"? What is the the crossover point
where you stop talking about the abstract concepts and get around to
talking about the details?
3. Are there ever situations where we don't use Abstraction? Where are the details that are so important that we cannot afford to miss them or hide them? |
